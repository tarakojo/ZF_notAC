  abstract  = {This paper presents a fixedpoint approach to inductive definitions. Instead of using a syntactic test such as `strictly positive,' the approach lets definitions involve any operators that have been proved monotone. It is conceptually simple, which has allowed the easy implementation of mutual recursion and other conveniences. It also handles coinductive definitions: simply replace the least fixedpoint by a greatest fixedpoint. This represents the first automated support for coinductive definitions.},
